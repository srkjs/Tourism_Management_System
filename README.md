# Tourism_Management_System
To establish a connection between VB 6.0 and Oracle SQL.  The main idea with which the project is built is Tamilnadu Tourism. This project has an interactive front end where the user can search for the desired city and find out the major places to visit in that particular city. It also has a filter option where the user can pick the desired place of visit such as entertainment, spiritual, travel, shopping and restaurants. A message section is also available for the users to post their messages, which will be delivered to the admin.  A login page with username and password is provided only for the application administrators. They can log in to read the user messages and respond accordingly. They are also provided with the permission to add, update and delete the information visible to the users.
